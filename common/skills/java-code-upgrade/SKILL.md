description: Upgrade Java code from older idioms to modern equivalents. Scans for legacy patterns (pre-Java 10 through Java 25) across language features, collections, strings, streams, concurrency, input/output, error handling, date/time, security, tooling, and enterprise APIs, then applies modern replacements. Use when modernizing Java codebases, reviewing pull requests for outdated patterns, or migrating from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Do not use for non-Java languages, build tool configuration, or framework-specific application logic.

# Purpose

Modernize Java code by identifying legacy patterns and applying modern replacements
sourced from 113 patterns across 11 categories (Java 7 through Java 25).

## Procedures

**Step 1: Determine Upgrade Scope**

1. Identify the target JDK version for the project. Check `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or `.java-version` for the configured source/target level. If unspecified, ask the user.
2. Identify which categories are relevant to the task:
   - `language` — var, records, sealed classes, pattern matching, switch expressions, text blocks
   - `collections` — immutable factories, sequenced collections, unmodifiable collectors
   - `strings` — isBlank, strip, repeat, lines, formatted, text blocks
   - `streams` — toList, mapMulti, gatherers, takeWhile/dropWhile, optional improvements
   - `concurrency` — virtual threads, structured concurrency, scoped values, stable values
   - `io` — HTTP client, Files API, Path.of, transferTo, memory-mapped files
   - `errors` — helpful NPE, multi-catch, optional chaining, null-in-switch
   - `datetime` — java.time API, Duration/Period, HexFormat, Math.clamp
   - `security` — PEM encoding, KDF, strong random, TLS defaults
   - `tooling` — JShell, single-file execution, JFR, AOT preloading
   - `enterprise` — EJB to CDI, Servlet to JAX-RS, JDBC to JPA/jOOQ, SOAP to REST, Spring modernization
3. If performing a full codebase scan, proceed to Step 2. If upgrading specific code, skip to Step 3.

**Step 2: Scan for Legacy Patterns**

1. Read `references/detection-patterns.md` to identify candidate patterns for the relevant categories.
2. For each candidate, search the codebase for the detection signatures listed (e.g., `Collections.unmodifiableList`, `new Thread(`, `.trim().isEmpty()`).
3. When a match is found, read the corresponding `references/{category}.md` file and locate the pattern by its title to retrieve the modern replacement.
4. Apply transformations directly. Use Git to review changes; no separate report is generated.

**Step 3: Upgrade Specific Code**

1. Identify which legacy pattern the code uses. If unsure, read `references/detection-patterns.md` and match against the code.
2. Open `references/{category}.md` and find the pattern by title or slug.
3. Apply the transformation following the modern code example. Adapt to the specific codebase context — do not blindly copy-paste.
4. Check for related patterns that often co-occur. The reference files list `related` patterns for each entry.

**Step 4: Enterprise Migration Path**

If the codebase involves Java EE or early Jakarta EE, read `references/enterprise.md` for the complete migration mappings:
- EJB to CDI beans
- Servlet to JAX-RS endpoints
- JSF managed beans to CDI named beans
- JNDI lookups to CDI injection
- JPA EntityManager to Jakarta Data repositories
- SOAP web services to Jakarta REST
- Message-driven beans to reactive messaging
- Manual transactions to declarative @Transactional
- Spring XML configuration to annotation-driven
- Spring null safety to JSpecify

**Step 5: Validate Upgrades**

1. Verify the target JDK version supports all applied patterns. Each pattern specifies its minimum JDK version.
2. Ensure no pattern requires a JDK version higher than the project target.
3. Run the project's existing test suite to confirm no regressions.
4. For patterns marked as preview features, verify the project enables preview: `--enable-preview`.

## Error Handling

- If a pattern requires a JDK version higher than the project target, flag it as "future upgrade" rather than applying it.
- If a detection signature matches but the code context differs from the pattern (e.g., intentional use of old API), skip the suggestion and note why.

## Don't do
- Type inference with var. I don't like this language feature and I don't want to see it in the code!!!
